      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown,

        powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.

    <h2>Kare-Kare</h2>
    <img src="./images/kare-kare.jpeg" alt="A picture of Kare-Kare" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This dish is rich in flavor due to the slow cooking of the oxtail. Oxtail
      can be cooked to tenderness a day before so you can skim off the fat
      making the dish more heart healthy. Using a pressure cooker will speed up
      cooking time, but will lose much of the flavor. Serve with rice and shrimp
      paste (bagoong).
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 ½ pounds beef oxtails</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
      <li>½ pound bok choy, chopped</li>
      <li>½ pound long beans, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
      <li>½ pound eggplant, cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon achiote powder</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the oxtails and water in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce
        heat to medium-low, and simmer at least 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim as much fat from the top of the liquid as possible. Crumble the
        beef bouillon cubes into the liquid and allow to dissolve. Remove the
        meat from the broth and set aside. Add the bok choy, long beans, and
        eggplant to the broth and simmer until tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the vegetables simmer in the broth, heat the olive oil in a large
        pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil
        until tender. Stir the achiote powder into the mixture to add a little
        color. Add the peanut butter and stir until it's melted into the
        mixture. Add about half the broth to the pot; bring to a simmer for 5
        minutes. Add the oxtails and cook another 5 minutes before adding the
        remaining broth with the vegetables. Serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for
      additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. If you want to, you can add what
      Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they
      look like potatoes. You can add five to six of them when you add the water
      and make sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked
      because they can get too soft.
